# Todo Console Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-First and Contract-Driven Development
All features must be specified before implementation begins. Specifications define clear contracts, acceptance criteria, and expected behaviors. No implementation work is permitted without an approved specification that details the feature requirements, interface contracts, and test cases.

### II. Agentic Development Stack
Development follows the sequence: Specification → Planning → Task Breakdown → Implementation. Each phase must be completed and approved before proceeding to the next. The Qwen agent is the sole implementer of code; humans are limited to prompt specification and review activities.

### III. In-Memory Storage Constraint (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The application uses in-memory storage only, with no file system, database, or external persistence. Data loss upon application exit is expected behavior. Any implementation of persistence mechanisms violates this constitution and renders the project non-compliant.

### IV. Command-Line Interface Focus
The application provides a command-line interface for all user interactions. The CLI must support human-readable output formats and follow standard input/output/error conventions (stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr). Commands must be intuitive and well-documented.

### V. Python 3.13+ Compliance
All code must be compatible with Python 3.13 or later versions. Code generation must follow PEP8 standards, utilize modern Python features appropriately, and maintain clean, maintainable code structure with proper type hints and documentation.

### VI. No Manual Code Intervention
Manual code writing, editing, or modification is strictly prohibited. All source code must be generated by the Qwen agent based on approved specifications and tasks. Direct edits to generated code invalidate the implementation and require regeneration.

## Additional Constraints

**Technology Stack**: Python 3.13+ only, with standard library preferred over external dependencies
**External Dependencies**: Minimize third-party libraries; prefer built-in Python modules
**Error Handling**: Clear, user-friendly error messages to stderr with appropriate exit codes
**Documentation**: All functions must have docstrings; CLI commands must have help text
**Testing**: Unit tests for all functions; integration tests for CLI commands

## Development Workflow

**Specification Phase**: Features defined with acceptance criteria, user stories, and test cases
**Planning Phase**: Architectural decisions documented with rationale and trade-offs
**Task Breakdown Phase**: Work decomposed into atomic, testable units with clear completion criteria
**Implementation Phase**: Code generation exclusively by Qwen agent based on approved tasks
**Review Process**: Specification and implementation review by human stakeholders before approval

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other development practices within the project. Amendments require formal documentation and approval following the same spec-driven approach. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Violations of the constitution invalidate the implementation and require remediation before project acceptance. The Qwen agent is the exclusive implementation tool; no other AI agents (including Claude) may be used.
