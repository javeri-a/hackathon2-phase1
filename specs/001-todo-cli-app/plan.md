# Implementation Plan: In-Memory Todo Console Application

**Branch**: `001-todo-cli-app` | **Date**: 2026-01-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a Python-based in-memory todo console application that allows users to add, list, update, complete, and delete tasks via CLI commands. The application stores all data in memory with no persistence, using Python 3.13+ and standard library components.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (argparse for CLI, uuid for IDs, dataclasses for models)
**Storage**: In-memory only (Python lists/dicts, no file or database persistence)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application
**Performance Goals**: <1 second response time for all operations (add, list, update, delete, complete)
**Constraints**: <100MB memory usage, no external dependencies beyond standard library
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application, up to 10,000 tasks in memory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Spec-First Development**: ✅ Confirmed - Implementation based on approved spec.md
2. **Agentic Development Stack**: ✅ Confirmed - Following Specification → Planning → Task Breakdown → Implementation sequence
3. **In-Memory Storage Constraint**: ✅ Confirmed - Plan specifies in-memory only storage
4. **Command-Line Interface Focus**: ✅ Confirmed - Using argparse for CLI implementation
5. **Python 3.13+ Compliance**: ✅ Confirmed - Targeting Python 3.13+
6. **No Manual Code Intervention**: ✅ Confirmed - Code will be generated by Qwen agent

*Post-design evaluation*:
- All requirements from spec.md have been incorporated into the design
- Data model (data-model.md) aligns with functional requirements
- Architecture supports all required features (add, list, update, complete, delete)
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) provides clear usage instructions
- Agent context updated with project-specific information

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen as appropriate for a console application. Models handle data representation, services encapsulate business logic, and CLI handles user interface. Tests are organized by type (unit, integration) and component.
